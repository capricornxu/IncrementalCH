-----Introduction-----
This is a project from for CS163 in Tufts and it performs the construction of a convex hull via incremental approach.


-----REQUIREMENTS-----
This project requires LEDA-6.1

-----What I learn-----
1> I learnt how to use leda
2> I learnt how to transform a geometric algorithm into a visualization program
3> I am more familiar with C++
4> I learnt how to debug using gdb command
5> I learnt how to write a complete Convex Hull algorithm. We assumed that the gien points are in general position in class. But I have to deal with them when I visualize it
6> I implemented a doubly linked list to maintain the points on Convex Hull
